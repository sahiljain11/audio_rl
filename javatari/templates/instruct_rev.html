          Hi! Thanks for participating in our study!
        </h1>  
        <p>
          We need your help to teach an Atari agent how to maximize its score during the MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE game.
          <p>Help PANAMA JOE safely reach Montezuma’s fantastic treasure by guiding him through a maze of death-dealing chambers within the emperor’s fortress.
            Along the way, PANAMA JOE must avoid an array of deadly creatures while he collects valuables and tools which can aid him in mastering the evils of the fortress and eventually, escaping with the loot!</p>
            <b>Arrow keys</b> are for moving, <b>SPACE</b> is to jump.
            More details in the <a href='https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=310' target='_blank'>original manual</a>.

        <p>
          First we ask you to play one practice game by clicking the "Start Trial" button below.
          <b>The game will not begin until you have clicked "Start New Game"</b> located at the bottom left of the screen.
          Additionally, please ensure that you are <b>using headphones</b> and that <b>your sound is on</b>.
          This trial period will take 1 minute to complete. If you play the game for 1 minute or more,
          the game will automatically end.
          Even though microphone access will be asked for, <b>your data will not be recorded for this round.</b>
