# Prosody as a Teaching Signal for Agent Learning: Exploratory Studies and Algorithmic Implications
The repository is composed of two parts: 

1) `wizard_of_oz`: a remote platform for emulating online interactive learning scenarios with audio feedback, in which one participant gives audio feedback to the agent, and another participant remotely controls the robot as a response to that feedback. Even though it was designed to emulate an interactive RL scenario with evaluative feedback in a grid-world Robotaxi task, it can be built upon to richer and more diverse scenarios that involve audio or speech feedback.

2) `javatari`: an application allowing a user to provide Atari game demonstrations with audio as an additional channel.
